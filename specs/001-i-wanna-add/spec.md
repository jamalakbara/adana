## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-20

- Q: What specific roles and permissions should content editors have in the CMS? → A: Multi-tier system: Admin (full access), Editor (edit/publish own content), Viewer (read-only access)
- Q: How should the system handle concurrent editing conflicts when multiple users edit the same content simultaneously? → A: Pessimistic locking: Content locked when being edited, others can only view
- Q: What validation rules should be enforced when content editors submit changes to ensure data quality and consistency? → A: Section-specific validation: Each section has its own required fields and validation rules
- Q: What specific limits and requirements should be enforced for image uploads (file sizes, dimensions, formats)? → A: Moderate constraints: Maximum 5MB file size, automatic resizing to web-optimized dimensions, support JPEG/PNG/WebP
- Q: What should be the complete workflow for content changes from draft to publication, including any approval steps? → A: Simple draft → publish: Editors save drafts and can publish directly without approval

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Content Editor Updates Website Sections (Priority: P1)

As a content editor, I want to update website section content through an admin interface so that I can keep the website current without technical assistance.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - enabling non-technical users to manage website content independently, reducing development dependencies and enabling faster content updates.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the admin interface, modifying content for any section, and verifying changes appear on the live website without requiring code deployment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged into the CMS admin on my desktop, **When** I edit the hero section title and description, **Then** the changes appear immediately on the homepage
2. **Given** I have uploaded a new logo through the CMS on my mobile device, **When** I view the website, **Then** the new logo is displayed in the navbar
3. **Given** I update client information in the marquee section using a tablet, **When** I refresh the homepage, **Then** the updated client information is displayed
4. **Given** I modify service descriptions from my phone, **When** I navigate to the services section, **Then** the new descriptions are shown
5. **Given** I am using the CMS admin interface on any device, **When** I access the dashboard, **Then** all features are fully functional and properly sized for my screen

### User Story 2 - Media Management with Supabase Storage (Priority: P1)

As a content editor, I want to upload and manage images through Supabase storage so that all website assets are centralized and optimized.

**Why this priority**: Critical for maintaining performance and consistency across the website while ensuring assets are properly managed and served efficiently.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by uploading various image types through the CMS interface and verifying they appear correctly on the website with proper optimization.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am in the media upload section, **When** I upload a hero background image, **Then** the image is stored in Supabase and displayed on the homepage
2. **Given** I upload client logos, **When** I view the marquee section, **Then** all logos are displayed with consistent sizing and quality
3. **Given** I replace portfolio images, **When** I browse the portfolio section, **Then** new images load quickly and display properly
4. **Given** I upload an invalid file type, **When** I attempt to upload, **Then** the system rejects the file with clear error messaging

### User Story 3 - Section Publishing Workflow (Priority: P2)

As a content editor, I want to draft, review, and publish content changes so that I can ensure content quality before making changes live.

**Why this priority**: Important for maintaining content quality and preventing accidental publication of incomplete or incorrect content.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating draft content, saving without publishing, and then publishing to verify the workflow functions correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have modified section content, **When** I save as draft, **Then** the changes are not visible on the live website
2. **Given** I have drafted changes for the about section, **When** I publish the changes, **Then** the updated content appears on the website
3. **Given** I have multiple section updates, **When** I publish all changes, **Then** all sections update simultaneously
4. **Given** I need to revert changes, **When** I access version history, **Then** I can restore previous content versions

### User Story 4 - Portfolio Management (Priority: P2)

As a content editor, I want to add, edit, and remove portfolio items so that I can showcase current work and remove outdated projects.

**Why this priority**: Portfolio content needs frequent updates to reflect current capabilities and remove outdated work.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding new portfolio items, editing existing ones, and removing items to verify all CRUD operations work correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am in the portfolio management section, **When** I add a new portfolio item with title, description, and images, **Then** the item appears in the portfolio section
2. **Given** I edit an existing portfolio item, **When** I update the project details, **Then** the changes are reflected on the website
3. **Given** I remove a portfolio item, **When** I refresh the portfolio section, **Then** the item is no longer displayed
4. **Given** I reorder portfolio items, **When** I view the portfolio section, **Then** items appear in the new order

---

### User Story 5 - Responsive Admin Interface (Priority: P1)

As a content editor, I want to access and use the CMS admin interface from any device (desktop, tablet, mobile) so that I can manage website content regardless of my location or device.

**Why this priority**: Critical for enabling content editors to work from anywhere and ensuring the CMS is usable on all devices, especially for urgent updates while away from desktop computers.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the admin interface on different device sizes and verifying all functionality works correctly with proper responsive design.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I access the CMS admin on a mobile phone, **When** I navigate through the interface, **Then** all menus, forms, and buttons are properly sized and functional
2. **Given** I am using a tablet to manage portfolio items, **When** I drag and drop to reorder items, **Then** the interaction works smoothly with touch controls
3. **Given** I upload images from my mobile device, **When** I access the media upload interface, **Then** file upload works correctly with mobile camera/gallery access
4. **Given** I switch between portrait and landscape orientation on any device, **When** the CMS interface loads, **Then** the layout adapts appropriately to the new orientation

### User Story 6 - Client Management (Priority: P3)

As a content editor, I want to manage client logos and information for the marquee section so that I can keep partnerships current and professional.

**Why this priority**: Client partnerships change periodically, but updates are less frequent than content updates.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding, editing, and removing client entries to verify the marquee section updates correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am in the client management section, **When** I add a new client with logo and link, **Then** the client appears in the marquee
2. **Given** I update a client's logo, **When** I view the homepage, **Then** the new logo is displayed
3. **Given** I remove a client, **When** the marquee loads, **Then** the removed client no longer appears
4. **Given** I reorder clients, **When** the marquee animates, **Then** clients appear in the new order
