# Research Findings: Website Content Management System

**Date**: 2025-01-20
**Purpose**: Research phase outcomes for CMS implementation

## Technology Decisions

### Supabase Integration Patterns
**Decision**: Use Supabase as database and storage backend
**Rationale**: Managed PostgreSQL service with built-in authentication, real-time capabilities, and storage. Aligns with constitution requirements and eliminates infrastructure management overhead.
**Alternatives considered**: Direct PostgreSQL (more operational overhead), Firebase (less type-safe), Custom database solution (higher complexity)

### Better Auth Implementation Strategy
**Decision**: Better Auth with development bypass pattern
**Rationale**: Provides secure authentication in production while enabling rapid development locally. Better Auth integrates well with Next.js 15 and Supabase, maintaining type safety throughout the auth flow.
**Alternatives considered**: NextAuth.js (deprecated), Auth0 (external dependency), Custom auth solution (higher security risk)

### Responsive Admin Interface Architecture
**Decision**: Mobile-first responsive design using Tailwind CSS v4
**Rationale**: Ensures CMS works across all devices as required. Tailwind CSS v4 provides modern responsive utilities and aligns with existing project styling approach. shadcn/ui components offer consistent design patterns.
**Alternatives considered**: Custom CSS (inconsistent styling), separate mobile admin app (higher maintenance), desktop-only admin (violates requirements)

### Content Management Architecture
**Decision**: Headless CMS pattern with Supabase as content repository
**Rationale**: Maintains separation between content and presentation, enables non-technical content management, and preserves existing page structure as required by constitution.
**Alternatives considered**: Traditional CMS with file-based storage (less scalable), Integrated page builders (breaks app/page.tsx structure), Static site generation (not suitable for dynamic content)

## Performance & Scalability Considerations

### Image Processing Strategy
**Decision**: Server-side image optimization with Supabase storage
**Rationale**: Balances performance (fast loading) with user experience (no client-side processing). Automatic resizing to web-optimized dimensions meets the 5MB constraint and 10-second upload requirement.
**Implementation notes**: Use Supabase Storage with image transformation functions, implement lazy loading, optimize formats (WebP support)

### Concurrency Management
**Decision**: Pessimistic locking for content editing
**Rationale**: Simple to implement and prevents data conflicts for small team of content editors (up to 5 concurrent users). Read-only access during editing provides clear user feedback.
**Implementation notes**: Lock status stored in Supabase, automatic timeout for locks, visual indicators in admin interface

### Real-time Updates
**Decision**: Polling-based updates for content changes
**Rationale**: Simpler implementation than WebSocket and sufficient for CMS use case. Reduces complexity while maintaining responsiveness.
**Implementation notes**: 30-second polling intervals, cache invalidation strategy, optimistic updates for better UX

## Security Considerations

### Role-Based Access Control
**Decision**: Multi-tier role system (Admin, Editor, Viewer)
**Rationale**: Provides appropriate access levels while maintaining simplicity. Better Auth handles session management and role validation.
**Implementation notes**: Role permissions stored in Supabase, middleware protection, client-side role-based UI rendering

### Content Validation
**Decision**: Server-side validation with Zod schemas
**Rationale**: Type-safe validation prevents bad data and provides clear error messages. Section-specific validation ensures data quality without being overly restrictive.
**Implementation notes**: Zod schemas per content type, validation middleware, client-side pre-validation for better UX

## Integration Patterns

### API Design
**Decision**: RESTful API with Next.js API routes
**Rationale**: Standard pattern for Next.js applications, easy to test and maintain. Integrates well with Supabase client and TypeScript.
**Implementation notes**: Consistent response format, error handling middleware, rate limiting

### State Management
**Decision**: React state with server state synchronization
**Rationale**: Leverages React 19 features and Next.js data fetching patterns. Avoids additional complexity of external state management libraries.
**Implementation notes**: React Query for server state, local state for UI interactions, optimistic updates

## Development Workflow Integration

### Build Process
**Decision**: Incremental builds with Turbopack
**Rationale**: Fast development experience while maintaining production optimization. Aligns with constitution build workflow requirements.
**Implementation notes**: Build on every change, error resolution pipeline, type checking integration

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: ESLint for code quality, Jest for unit testing (phase 2)
**Rationale**: Ensures code quality while keeping development velocity. Unit testing to be added after core implementation.
**Implementation notes**: ESLint configuration as gate, Jest setup for critical business logic, integration testing for API endpoints

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Migration
**Strategy**: Incremental migration with rollback capability
**Rationale**: Minimizes risk of data loss and allows gradual transition. Supabase provides migration tools and versioning.
**Implementation notes**: Backup strategy, migration scripts, validation procedures

### Performance Monitoring
**Strategy**: Key metrics tracking and alerting
**Rationale**: Ensures performance targets are met (3-second page load, 2-second admin interface). Early detection of issues.
**Implementation notes**: Core Web Vitals monitoring, API response time tracking, error rate monitoring

## Technology Stack Justification

All technology choices align with constitution requirements:
- **Next.js 15**: Modern web stack with App Router and Turbopack
- **TypeScript**: Type safety first principle
- **Supabase**: CMS-driven content management with managed database
- **Better Auth**: Authentication with development bypass
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Responsive design and consistency
- **shadcn/ui**: Component library integration

No gaps or violations identified. All requirements can be met with chosen stack.
